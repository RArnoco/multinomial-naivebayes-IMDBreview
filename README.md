### Download Dataset 
This algorithm is build with the help of a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/purvitsharma/imdb-sentiment-analysis-90-accuracy)

## What is this?
Multinomial-Naive Bayes is commonly used in NLP prediction and classification of text, but sometimes sentiment analysis. According to the article [1], the algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article. It calculates the probability of each tag for a given sample and then gives the tag with the highest probability as output.

## The Project
The ML algorithm itself is to classifiy whether the opinion or sentiment of a specific comment is **POSITIVE or NEGATIVE**, with the use of the given dataset. The algorithm purely used python, multi-nomial naive bayes and other libraries such as numpy, scikit, etc.
